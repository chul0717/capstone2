**Brief company info:**
The Bake is a franchise bakery cafe that is located in South Korea. We are located in various locations including, subway stations, shopping malls and hotels. At our store we sell affordable cups of coffee along with more than 30 bakery goods to choose from. We strive to provide fresh roasted, fresh baked products to our customers everyday. 

**Business Probem:**
In order to prepare the bakery products, the employee must allow enough time to ferment the dough and bake it. Since freshness is an important aspect of The Bake's core compentency it is crucial for store owners to get a sense of future revenue to make sure the demand is not over or under supplied. If there is not enough bread, opportunity will be lost. If there is too much bread, customers will not buy it fast enough and the products will lose its freshness.
